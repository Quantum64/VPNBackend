Installing the Q64 VPN on a Mac
===
Installing the VPN's certificate is the first step, this allows your Mac to validate tha authenticity of the VPN upon connection.
Unfortunantly the installation of the certificate is not as simple as it is on Windows, but if you follow this guide exactly,
you will have no issues.

1) Click the certificate link labeled OSX on your (account page)[http://net.q64.co].  This will download the certificate.
